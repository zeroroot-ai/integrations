# AGENTS.md — gitlab connector

This directory is a **Gibson connector**: a declarative MCP integration
(ADR-0065 R6). The single `connector.yaml` manifest IS the connector — there is
no Go code and no image to build. gibson embeds first-party manifests and
derives one catalog `Entry` per file; a self-hosted fork loads its own via the
same path.

## The manifest schema

`connector.yaml` fields (mirrors gibson's
`internal/platform/connectorcatalog`):

- `id` — stable catalog id and tool namespace (`mcp:<id>:<tool>`). Required.
- `vendor` — the vendor this integrates. Metadata, not the key.
- `displayName` / `description` — catalog UI copy.
- `shape` — `Remote` (a vendor-hosted MCP server gibson proxies) or `Hosted`
  (a container image gibson runs on ToolHive).
- `endpoint` — the vendor MCP URL. **Remote only** (must be unset for Hosted).
- `image` — the container image. **Hosted only** (must be unset for Remote).
- `transport` — the MCP transport the server speaks (e.g. `streamable-http`).
- `egressAllow` — `host:port` targets the connector may reach.
- `auth` — `none | secret | oauth`.
- `oauthScope` — the vendor OAuth scope hint when `auth: oauth`.

## Validate

`go test ./...` parses `connector.yaml` and applies the same shape invariants
gibson's catalog loader enforces (a Remote needs an endpoint and no image; a
Hosted needs an image and no endpoint; `auth` must be one of the three values).
The test never imports gibson — the integrations repo must not depend on the
platform.

## Do not

- Do **not** add Go handler code — a connector is declarative. If you need Go
  logic, you want a **plugin** (`--kind plugin`), not a connector.
- Do **not** set both `endpoint` and `image`.
- Do **not** put a credential in the manifest — `auth`/`oauthScope` describe how
  gibson obtains one at runtime through the broker.
