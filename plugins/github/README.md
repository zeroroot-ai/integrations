# github plugin

A Gibson **plugin** (ADR-0065): a Go service that runs curated read/write logic
against the GitHub REST API through [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github).

It is Go-first — the method contracts are derived by the SDK from the typed Go
structs in `handler.go`, so there is no `.proto` and no generated code.

## Curated methods

| Method | Kind | GitHub call |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GetRepository` | read | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` |
| `ListIssues` | read | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` |
| `CreateIssue` | write | `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` |

A plugin exposes a stable, mission-shaped surface — a curated subset of the
vendor API — not the vendor's entire client.

## Credential

One GitHub token (a PAT or GitHub App installation token) resolved from the
secrets broker, declared in `plugin.yaml` as `cred:github_token`. The broker is
the only credential channel — the plugin never reads a token from an env var,
and never puts it in a log line or an error.

## Test

```sh
go test ./...   # hermetic cassette replay — no daemon, no network, no token
```

`handler_test.go` replays committed `testdata/*.json` cassettes of the go-github
HTTP calls through a cassette-backed client, so the whole suite runs offline.

See **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** for the full contract.
