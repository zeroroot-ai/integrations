# Deploy checklist for example

Plugins are stateful and usually have one or two replicas (depending
on whether your underlying integration tolerates concurrent state).
Production plugins are deployed through the Gibson umbrella chart,
[`zeroroot-ai/charts`](https://github.com/zeroroot-ai/charts), never by hand.

## Before deploy

- [ ] `make build` succeeds with the pinned SDK version
- [ ] `gibson component validate` passes (manifest schema clean)
- [ ] All declared secrets exist in the tenant's broker
- [ ] `gibson inspect` shows the plugin principal with the expected
      `can_resolve` grants
- [ ] `make image` produces a tagged image (semver)
- [ ] Image pushed and reachable from the cluster

## Manifest and runtime modes

`spec.runtime` in `plugin.yaml` controls deployment shape:

| Mode      | What it means                           | When to use         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `process` | Same pod as the daemon (or sidecar)     | Default; dev + small prod |
| `pod`     | Standalone Deployment, gRPC over network| Most production      |
| `setec`   | microVM sandbox per call (Setec)        | Untrusted egress     |

Most plugins use `pod`. Set in the manifest:

```yaml
spec:
  runtime: pod
  policy:
    setec_required: false
```

## Manifest essentials

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: plugin
        image: <registry>/example:0.1.0
        env:
        - name: GIBSON_URL
          value: <daemon URL>
        # Bootstrap token mounted from a Secret seeded by RegisterPlugin.
        # SDK consumes it once on first start, then exclusively uses host_key.
        - name: GIBSON_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef: { name: example-bootstrap, key: token }
        volumeMounts:
        - name: host-key
          mountPath: /home/nonroot/.gibson/plugin/example
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080  # health
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: 8080 }
          periodSeconds: 10
      volumes:
      - name: host-key
        emptyDir: {}  # persisted across restarts via PVC in real prod
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60  # plugin.Serve graceful drain
```

## Production discipline

- Production Kubernetes is GitOps-driven. **Do not `kubectl apply`** in
  prod without explicit approval.
- The dev kind cluster is fine for `kubectl apply`.
- Image tags must be immutable.
- `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` ≥ 30 so `OnStop` hooks and the
  drain in `plugin.Serve` complete before SIGKILL.
- The plugin must be allowed to write `~/.gibson/plugin/example/`
  to persist `host_key`. `runAsUser` matters — use a writeable
  emptyDir or PVC mount.

## Exit code 75 — restart policy

When a `rotation: restart` secret rotates, the plugin exits 75. The
default Kubernetes `restartPolicy: Always` (within a Deployment)
restarts it automatically. Don't add custom logic that conflates 75
with crashes.

## Setec mode

If you set `runtime: setec` and `policy.setec_required: true`, every
invocation runs in a microVM with the manifest's `spec.egress[]` list
as the firewall allowlist. Verify your declared egress targets cover
every external host the plugin contacts.
